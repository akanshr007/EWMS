# EWMS (Enterprise Workload Management System)

## Overview

EWMS is a comprehensive solution designed to represent the Profit and Loss (P&L) via effort - planned vs actual of projects by capturing the working hours of project team members corresponding to specific projects. It enables project managers (PMs) to track the time spent by resources on projects, compare it with original estimates, and evaluate the project's profitability. This information helps refine future estimations and improve project management efficiency.

## Features

- **Work Logging**: Team members can log their work hours for specific projects.
- **Effort Tracking**: Track planned vs. actual effort for each project.
- **P&L Representation**: Calculate and display the profit or loss of projects based on the original estimation and actual time cost.
- **Estimation Refinement**: Use historical data to refine future project estimations and improve accuracy.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports showing time spent, original estimates, and variances.

## Usage

### Logging Work Hours

Team members can log their work hours for a particular project through the system. This feature ensures that all efforts are recorded accurately, facilitating the calculation of actual time spent on the project.

### Viewing Project Details

PMs can view detailed information about each project, including:

- Project name
- Planned effort
- Actual effort
- Time spent by each team member
- Original estimation
- Variance between planned and actual effort

### Profit and Loss Calculation

The system calculates the profit or loss of each project by comparing the original estimation with the actual time cost. This information is crucial for evaluating project performance and making informed decisions.

### Refining Estimations

Based on the data collected from previous projects, PMs can refine their future estimations, leading to more accurate project planning and improved resource allocation.
